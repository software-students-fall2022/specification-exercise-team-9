## Stakeholders

Interviewed: Andy Huang, Nicola Rios  
Goals:

- reduce wait time at dining halls, sometimes food takes too long
- wish there was way to see in real time what foods are available at different dining halls
- have an easier and more direct may of providing feedback to dining halls
- have a way to monitor expedintures
- be able to track my food consumption throughout the week, dieting purposes

Frustrations:

- sometimes there are communication issues when ordering food, especially during covid with glass separation
- dining halls sometimes get chaotic, particularly during lunch and dinner
- there are no ways to order food at dining halls other than Kimmel or Upstein
- there are no ways to order food ahead of time, like in case I only have 20 minutes to get lunch between classes
